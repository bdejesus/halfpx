  %p.leadin Half Pixels is a site for my photography work. I shoot a lot of black and white photography, but there are also some color in there. I like black and white because it helps tell a more focused story &mdash; color isn't a distraction. I only use color if I feel that it is essential to the narrative that is happening in the photo.

  %p None of the photos in these sets were precomposed. Each a moment in time captured â€“ random and unique.

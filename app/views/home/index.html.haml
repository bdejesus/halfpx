    %h2 This is my photography.

    %p.leadin I mostly black and white and some color. Black and white photography helps tell a more focused story where color isn't a distraction. Color is only present if it is essential to the narrative.

    %p None of these photos were precomposed. Each is a moment in time captured â€“ random and unique.
